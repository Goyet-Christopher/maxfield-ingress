Changes: 26 Feb 2016
1. Implemented JBaker's new algorithm which does not use the "random"
   algorithm to generate linking strategy. Instead it "smartly" chooses
   the best strategy. In the case of a large number of portals, this
   strategy may be sub-optimal (i.e. not max AP/links/fields).
2. Added an option for force optimal if desired.
3. Added support for SoftBank Link Amps (up to 40 outgoing links)
4. Added faction color scheme
5. Fixed link csv file
